Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The client DriverPass wanted to implement an online cloud based system so that they could corner the market on a percieved lack of competition.
They will provide online tests and resources as well as a physical aspect to instill confidence within users and supply them with the tools needed to complete their driving exam.
What did you do particularly well?
- I was able to identify and expand upon the needs that the client has provided by thinking beyond the provided substance and supplying more. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would look more into some of the diagram that I created and implemented during this project. It was my first time working with process and object models directly and I feel
as if I could have done more with them If I had more of a focus on the aspects of the diagram and how to mold them into something that reflected the clients desired endstate.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- Some aspects were left intentionally vague such as the connection to the dmv or the exact needs that an admin would have in the process. Personally I expanded on the admins role
and provided a little more than what was asked in the transcript. It's important to think about what else the client might need that they haven't considered as much as that's the difference between good work and great work. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I approach is timidly as I am still growing into the process and finding my own confidence and methods of completing desired goals. I think my main take away from this class will be to think about things more
as they interact and affect each other as well as utilizing tools like in-depth diagrams and models to more effectivly test my own understanding of the subject.
